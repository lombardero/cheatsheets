---> GIT & HOW TO DO THINGS <---

Forking
    -> Always create a fork when working in something on your own
        - git checkout -b my-feature
            -> creates a new branch 'my-new-feature' and move to it
        - git add (files)
        - git commit -m 'initial working version of my new feature'
        - git push -u origin my-new-feature
            -> creates a bond with 'my-new-feature' branch, so each
               time 'git push' command is called, it goes to the new
               branch
        - git add
        - git commit -m 'added this cool stuff'
        - git push
            -> pushes the code to 'my-new-feature' branch
    -> once 'my-new-feature' is completed, it is ready to be merged
       with the code in 'master'. For that, add a pull request:
        - git request-pull -p master https://github... my-new-feature
            -> master is the "start point" where you forked from (usually
               master)
            -> url of the remote repository where the new feature is
            -> m-new-branch in the endpoint (what I've done so far and
               what I want to merge to the master branch)

Pull requests in ZenHub 
    -> Always connect a pull request to an issue. This can be done in
       GitHub's page (with ZenHub extension allowed) once the pull 
       request has been launched. Just go to the pull request and click
       'connect this pull request with an existing issue'
