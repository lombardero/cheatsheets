# OOP Principles: 3 Polymorphism


Polymorphism is the idea of naming consistently across different classes.  Basically: using the same name for things that conceptually do the same. 

> Example: in python, the function `len()`  works for lists, tuples, and dictionaries (`len()` is actually a method from each of these Classes).
