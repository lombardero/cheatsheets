When we are dealing with dataframes, things can get confused very quickly,
we can however do some simple things to understand it propelry.

	1) Check out the .head, .info, .and describe of the dataframe
		->  These will give us vital info and understanding on the df
	2) Make an sns.pairplot of the dataframe
		->  Matrix comparing all data with eachother (useful to see
			correlations)
	3) Make an sns.distplot (histogram) of the data we want to predict
		->  Will help us understand it better
	4) Make a heatmap of the correlation of each column
		->  sns.heatmap(df.corr()): will help us visualize possible
			correlations (low colors mean low correlations)
