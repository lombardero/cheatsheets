Transforms are common image transformations (crop, brightness,
contrast, rotation...). They are created as classes, later taken
as arguments in functions.

Basic Transforms
    tensor = transforms.ToTensor(image)
        -> transforms an image (PIL.Image or numpy.ndarray) in the
           [0, 255] range of shape [H x W x C] to a torch.FloatTensor
           of shape (C x H x W) in the range [0.0, 1.0]
           (H = height, W = width, C = channel)
    norm = transforms.Normalize((mean1,mean2,mean3),
                                    (std1,std2,std3))
        -> Creates a "transform" object that will normalize any
           data with 3 channels (RBG) to have the means and stds
           specified
    

Combine transformations
    trans = transforms.Compose([transform1,..., transformn])
        -> creates a transformation combining all specified 
           transforms
