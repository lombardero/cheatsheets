# The Numpy library

Numpy is the building block for Pandas. It enables python to work with matrices, called
numpy arrays in the numpy world. Pytorch also uses Numpy as a building block.

## Import the module
```python
import numpy as np
```

# 1 - Basics

## 1.1 Creating arrays

### Providing all the data

Arrays can be created from any iterator function in python. The usual way of
defining an array is with a series of nested lists of the same size: every
sub-list will be the data stored in a row (all rows must be of the same size).

```py

arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```
- Creates a numpy array with the provided data.

### Creating arrays from a function

```py
np.arange(s,e+1,stp)
```
- Creates an evenly spaced vector with a step `stp` starting at `s` and ending
  at `e` (`e+1` is not included)

```py
np.linspace(s,e,n)
```
- Creates an evenly spaced vector of `n` elements starting at `s` and ending at `e`

```py
np.zeros((r,c))
```
- Creates a matrix ofzeros of `r` rows and `c` columns (Note that input should be a tuple)

> Note: If input is a scalar, it will create a vector
```py
np.ones((r,c))
```
- Creates matrix of ones with `r` rows and `c` columns

```py
np.eye(r)
```
- Creates an identity matrix of `r` rows

```py
np.random.rand((r,c))
```
- Creates matrix of r rows and c columns of random numbers b/w 0 and 1 following an uniform
  distribution (can use a lot of other distr)

```py
np.random.randn(r,c)
```
- Creates matrix with random numbers following normal distr with mu=0 and sigma = 1 (do not use a tuple in this one)

```py
np.random.randint(s,e,(r,c))
```
- Creates a matrix of random values between `s` and `e` with `r` rows and `c` columns

## 1.2 Basic  functions

Each of the below functions are done element-wise.

```py
arr1 + arr2
```
- Sums one by one the elements of each arrays

```py
arr1 * arr2
```
- Multiplies one by one the elements of each arrays

```py
arr + k
```
- Sums k to each element of array

```py
arr * k
```
- Multiplies k to each element of array
- Use `**` to elevate to the power of `k` each element of the array

```py
np.sqrt(arr)
np.sin(arr)
np.cos(arr)
np.log(arr)
np.exp(arr)
```
- Runs element-wise `sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `log`, and `exp` functions

```py
np.sum(arr)
# Or alternatively
arr.sum()
```
- Returns the sum of all elements in the array

```py
np.std(arr)
# Or alternatively
arr.std()
```
- Returns the standard deviation of the elements in the array


```py
sum(arr)
```
- Sums all rows of the array
- Optional arguments
  - `axis=0`: returns a vector sum with all rows of the array (default)
  - `axis=1`: sums all columns of the array

```py
len(array)
```
- Returns number of elements in the array

	Reshape/copy
		arr.reshape(r,c): reshapes array of values (vector or whatever) into a new
						  matrix of r rows and c columns (len(array) needs to = r*c)
		arr.copy(): creates a copy of the array arr
	Indexing (in python indexes start at 0)
		-Note on indexing: if we use indexing to create a smaller vector from a 
		 bigger one, if we change the value of the small, the big will also be
		 affected (we can solve this problem by creating a copy of the vector)
		1D (Vectors)
			arr[n]: gives nth number of the array (can be used to set)
			arr[s,e]: gives sth to eth (not included) element of the array
			arr[s:]: gives sth element of the array until the end
			arr[:e+1]: gives start until eth (not included)element of the array
		2D (Matrices)
			arr[r,c] (OR arr[r][c]) : will give the element of the row r and column c
									  can use 's:e' notation to grab parts
					note: to select full columns (and avoid numpy selecting them as
						  row), we will need to indicate arr(:,c:(c+1)), where c is the
						  column we want.
			arr[-r,-c]: gives numbers of rows and cols starting from the end (count
						starts at 1)
			arr[r]: will give all the r row of the matrix
	Boolean Operators
		arr > k: will give a boolean array bool_arr that verifyes the condition,
				 in this case, digits that are > k (can use >,<,==,!=...)
		arr[bool_arr]: returns the indexes of arr that are True in bool_arr
					   (note that dim(arr) should = dim(bool_arr))
		arr[arr > k]: directly gives the sub-set of arr that verifyes the boolean 
					  condition in the brackets
	Matrix rand
		np.matmul(A,B): multiplies matrices A & B
		np.transpose(A): transposes matrix A
		np.random.randn(rows,cols)
			-> creates a matrix of the dimensions specified with random numbers
			   of a normal distribution of mean 0 and std 1
Functions
		arr.max(): gives max value of an array arr
		arr.argmax(): gives in which argumment of the array arr the max value is
					  located
		arr.min(): gives min value of an array arr
		arr.argmin(): gives in which argumment of the array arr the min value is
					  located
		arr.shape: gives the tuple with the number of rows and cols (r,c)
		np.mean(list): returns the mean of all values in the list
PCA
		np.cov(dataset)
			-> computes the covariance matrix of the dataset (data must be stored
			   by rows)
		eigVal, eigVec = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)
			-> computes the eigenvalues (1D vector) and eigenvectors (matrix, vectors
			   by columns)
```
