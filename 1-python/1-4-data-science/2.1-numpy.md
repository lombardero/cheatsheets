# The Numpy library

Numpy is the building block for Pandas. It enables python to work with matrices, called
numpy arrays in the numpy world. Pytorch also uses Numpy as a building block.

## Import the module
```python
import numpy as np
```

# 1 - Basics

## 1.1 Creating arrays

### Providing all the data

Arrays can be created from any iterator function in python. The usual way of
defining an array is with a series of nested lists of the same size: every
sub-list will be the data stored in a row (all rows must be of the same size).

```py
arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```
- Creates a numpy array with the provided data.

### Creating arrays from a function

```py
np.arange(s,e+1,stp)
```
- Creates an evenly spaced vector with a step `stp` starting at `s` and ending
  at `e` (`e+1` is not included)

```py
np.linspace(s,e,n)
```
- Creates an evenly spaced vector of `n` elements starting at `s` and ending at `e`

```py
np.zeros((r,c))
```
- Creates a matrix ofzeros of `r` rows and `c` columns (Note that input should be a tuple)

> Note: If input is a scalar, it will create a vector
```py
np.ones((r,c))
```
- Creates matrix of ones with `r` rows and `c` columns

```py
np.eye(r)
```
- Creates an identity matrix of `r` rows

```py
np.random.rand((r,c))
```
- Creates matrix of r rows and c columns of random numbers b/w 0 and 1 following an uniform
  distribution (can use a lot of other distr)

```py
np.random.randn(r,c)
```
- Creates matrix with random numbers following normal distr with mu=0 and sigma = 1 (do not use a tuple in this one)

```py
np.random.randint(s,e,(r,c))
```
- Creates a matrix of random values between `s` and `e` with `r` rows and `c` columns

## 1.2 Basic functions

Each of the below functions are done element-wise.

```py
arr1 + arr2
```
- Sums one by one the elements of each arrays

```py
arr1 * arr2
```
- Multiplies one by one the elements of each arrays

```py
arr + k
```
- Sums k to each element of array

```py
arr * k
```
- Multiplies k to each element of array
- Use `**` to elevate to the power of `k` each element of the array

```py
np.sqrt(arr)
np.sin(arr)
np.cos(arr)
np.log(arr)
np.exp(arr)
```
- Runs element-wise `sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `log`, and `exp` functions

```py
np.sum(arr)
# Or alternatively
arr.sum()
```
- Returns the sum of all elements in the array

```py
np.std(arr)
# Or alternatively
arr.std()
```
- Returns the standard deviation of the elements in the array


```py
sum(arr)
```
- Sums all rows of the array
- Optional arguments
  - `axis=0`: returns a vector sum with all rows of the array (default)
  - `axis=1`: sums all columns of the array

```py
len(array)
```
- Returns number of elements in the array

## 1.3 Filtering data

### 1.3.1 Through boolean operators

```py
arr > k
```
- will give a boolean array bool_arr that verifyes the condition, in this case, digits that are `> k`

```py
arr[bool_arr]
```
- returns the indexes of arr that are `True` in `bool_arr` (note that `dim(arr)` should
  be equal to `dim(bool_arr)`). Example: `arr[arr > k]`

### 1.3.2 Through indexing

> Note: in `numpy`, indexing arrays will create pointers to a subset of the components
> of the already existing array. This means that modifying the filtered values will
> also affect the original array.

#### Vectors (1D)

```py
arr[n]
```
- Returns `n`th number of the array (can be used to set its value as well)

```py
arr[s,e]
```
- Returns the `s`th to the `e`th (`e` not included) elements of the array

```py
arr[s:]
```
- Returns `s`th element of the array until the end. We can also use `arr[:e+1]`
  to access elements from start to `e`th element included.

#### Matrices (2D)

```py
arr[r,c] # Or arr[r][c]
```
- Returns the element in the `r` row r and `c` columns
> Note: we can use `s:e` instead of single integers to access a range of values,
> or use negative numbers to start counting from the end
> Note 2: we can use `arr[r]` to select all the values from a given row (numpy
> will return a row vector)
> Note 3: to select a full column and avoid numpy returning it as a row vector, we
> can use the `arr[:,c:(c+1)]` syntax, where `c` is the column index we want

## 1.4 Miscellaneous functions

### 1.4.1 Reshape & copy arrays

```py
arr.reshape(r,c)
```
- reshapes array of values (vector or whatever) into a new matrix of `r` rows and `c`
  columns (`len(array)` needs to be equal to `r*c`)

```py
arr.copy()
```
- Creates a copy of the array

### 1.4.2 Common functionalities
```py
arr.max()
```
- Returns max value of an array

```py
arr.argmax()
```
- Returns the indexes where the max value in the array is located

```py
arr.min()
```
- Returns min value of an array

```py
arr.argmin()
```
- Returns the indexes where the min value in the array is located

```py
arr.shape
```
- Returns the tuple with the number of rows and cols (r,c)

```py
np.mean(list)
```
- Returns the mean of all values in the list

### 1.4.3 Matrix functions

```py
np.matmul(A,B)
```
- Multiplies matrices `A` & `B`

```py
np.transpose(A)
```
- transposes matrix `A`

```py
np.random.randn(r,c)
```
- Creates random matrix (normal distr, mean 0 and std 1) with `r` rows and `c`
  columns

### 1.4.4 Principal component analysis

```py
```
- computes the covariance matrix of the dataset (data must be stored by rows)

```py
eig_val, eig_vec = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)
```
- computes the eigenvalues (1D vector) and eigenvectors (matrix, vectors by columns)
