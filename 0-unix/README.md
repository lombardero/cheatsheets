# Unix cheathseets

Unix is treated in a very chaotic way. Rather than a linear path, the cheathseets
are spead around in categories, quite arbitrarily, depending on the needs.

Here are the current contents in a pseudo-organised way from basic level and utility.

- [Basic commands](basic-cmd.md) (generic)
- [Basic Unix filesystem organisation](basic-filesystem.md)
- [Work with files in Linux](files.md)
- [Searching files](query-files.md)
- [Running processes](processes.md)
- [Users and permissions](users-perm.md)
- [Shell scripting](shell-script.md)
- [Vi and Vim](vi-vim.md)
- [SSH and SCP](ssh-scp.md)
- [Updating and downloading packages](udpate-dwl-package.md)
- [System maintenance](logs-rebt.md): get logs, reboot
- [Networking in Linux](networking.md)
- [Networking additional: NIC bonding](nic-bond.md)
- [Aliases](aliases.md)
- [Basic system utilities](sys-utilities.md)
