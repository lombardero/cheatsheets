---> PYTHON FUNCTIONS OBJECTS <---

Functions are python objects taking a set of arguments (or none), and
performing a set of operations. They can be held un-executed.
Functions are  first-class citizens in python, meaning they can be 
passed as arguments in other functions, returned by other functions,
and even assigned to variables.

Example 1:
    def square (x):
        return x*x
    
    f = square(5)
        -> will set f to 25
    f = square
        -> will set f as a function object equal to the function called
           'square'
        -> if f(5) is ran, it will return 25

Example 2: function as an argument
    def map_f (fun, array):
        result = []
        for i in array:
            result.append(fun(i))
        return result
    
    map_f(square, [1,2,3,4])
        -> will return [1,4,9,16]

Example 3:
    def html_tag_msg(tag):
        def wrap_msg(msg):
            print ('<{0}>{1}</{0}>').format((tag, msg))
        return wrap_msg
    
    print_h1 = html_tag_msg('h1')
        -> will create a new function wrap_msg with the tag 'h1' (waiting
           for a message to return a string).
    print_h1('hello world')
        -> will return <h1>hello world</h1>
