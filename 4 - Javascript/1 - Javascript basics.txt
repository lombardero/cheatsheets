BASICS
    Basic operators
        +, -, * sum, substraction, multiplication
        = assigning value
        +=, -=, *=, /= sums, substracts, multiplies, or divides the operator by a value and assigns it
        var++, var--, adds one or substracts one to the variable
    Boolean operators
        a == b returns True if a = b (does not care of type, ex= 3 == '3' -> True)
        a === b returns True if a = b (here, 3==='3' -> False)
        a != b (opposite as ==)
        a !== b (opposite as ===)
        <, >, <=, >= compares a and b in a loose way (does not care of type)
        a && b computes a AND b
        a || b  computes a OR by

    Variable types
        Types
            -  number: all numeric variable types (integers, float...)
            -  string
            -  boolean
            -  null
            -  undefined
            -  object: arrays, python dictionnaries
        Defining variables
            var number1 = 1
                -> declares a variable called 'number1', and fixes it equal to 1
            typeof number1
                -> returns a string with the variable type of "number1"
            const CONSTANT_VARIABLE = 3
                -> defines a constant variable that won't change throughout the program (in caps and using '_')
                   by convention
    Requesting Input
        new_var = prompt("Tell me the new variable")
            -> asks the console to introduce the variable (same as input())
    Printing results
        console.log(var)
            -> prints variable in he console
        alert(var)
            -> prints variable (where?)
        numbr.toFixed(n)
            -> prints the variable numbr as a string with n numbers after the comma
    STRING operations
        Number("34") returns the string as a number
        String(34) returns the number as a string
        str.length
            -> returns the string length (no of characters)
        str.toUpperCase()
            -> returns the string in upper case (does not modify str)
    OBJECT datatypes
        "Dictionnaries"
            Definition:
                var obj = {
                    a: "hello",
                    b: 42,
                }
            Calling variable:
                - Syntax 1:
                a.obj;
                    -> returns "hello"
                - Syntax 2:
                obj["a"]
                    -> returns value of a ("hello")
        arrays
            Definition
                var arr = ["Ã±o", 34]
            Calling values:
                arr[0];
            Checking length:
                arr.length;
CONDITIONS + FUNCTIONS
    {...}
        -> defines a Block: they are needed to limit conde inside a conditional statement
    IF statements:       
        -> Syntax 1: (need to put ';' after each line to separate different statements)
        if (True) {
            a++;
            console.log(a);
        }
        else if (boolean condition){
            computation
        }
        else {
            console.log('Bullshit');
        }
        -> Syntax 2: use switch, case instead of stating each condition for the variable
        switch(a){
            case 2:     //if a == 2
                computation
                break;
            case 10:    //if a == 10
                computation
                break;
        }
    WHILE statements: 
        -> Syntax 1: the iteration will go ahead only if the statement is true, if it is
           False, no computation will be done
        while (True) {
            console.log(a);
        }
        -> Syntax 2: the computation is done first, THEN it checks if the statement is true,
           in that case it computes the "do" activity first
        do {
            console.log(a);
        } while (True)
        -> break statements can be used inside while loops to stop them
    FOR loops
        -> Syntax: for (define start, boolean value 'continue until False', step definition)
        for (var i = 0, i <= 9, i += 1) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    FUNCTION definitions
        -> Syntax 1: without needing an input variable
        function newFunction() {
            var a = 1; //this variable only belongs to the function
            a++
        }
        -> Syntax 2: with an input variable
        function newFunction(a) {
            return a+2;
        }
        -> Note 0: functions can only access variables inserted in their inputs
        -> Note 1: variables defined within functions can only be accessed by that function
        -> Note 2: functions defined INSIDE a function can access any variable created in the
                   first function
        -> Note 3: global variables (constants) defined by 'const' can be accessed by functions
                   without needing it to be inputted
