--> GIT COMMANDS <--
https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/command-line-101

BASIC
	command --help
		-> gets help of any command

FOLDER NAVIGATION
	Move through folders
		cd Desktop/
			-> "Change directory":goes to 'Desktop' folder on the current directory
		cd ..
			-> moves to the upwards directory
		pwd
			-> "Print Working Directory": returns current directory
	Show contents
		ls
			-> lists current directory contents
		ls -l
			-> lists contents in a better format
		ls -a
		ls -la
			-> lists all files in current repository including hidden ones (add 'l' to make the format nicer)
	Move/Remove/Create
		rm directory/file.txt
			-> removes file.txt in directory 
		rm -r directory1/directory2
			-> removes directory2 in directory1 (-r : "Recursive")
		mv directory_old/file.txt directory_new/file.txt
			-> moves file.txt from directory_old to directory_new
		mv file_old.txt file_new.txt
			-> renames file_old.txt into file_new.txt
		mkdir new_directory
			-> creates new_directory in current location

GIT
	Initializing
		git init
			-> creates a Git folder ('.git') with an empty repository
		   	   (.git folder is a hidden archive for Git to do its stuff)
		git status
			-> shows status of current Git branch (showing added files, and branch)
	Adding files to Git repository
		git add file.py
			-> adds file.py to the Git repository
		git add -A
			-> adds all files of the current folder in the Git folder
		git commit
			-> creates a "snapshot" of the current file status (that is what will be saved in the git file)
	Updating data on Github
		git remote add origin https://github....
			-> creates a new connection to the remote repository specified in the URL and names it "origin" (name can be changed)
		git remote -v
			-> remote without anything will show you the current remote repositories, v: verbose -> tells you extra info about each of them
		git push -u origin master
			-> "pushes" or updates the local data to the virtual repository. 
			-> '-u' creates a bond between 'origin/master' (local Git repository) and the virtual 'master' on Github. '-u' needs to be called one time only to do the bonding
	Pulling data from Github
		git fetch origin master
			-> updates 'origin/master' local Git folder from the data of the 'master' virtual folder on Github, but does not merge it with the local 'master' folder (the actual .txt files on the PC)
		git merge origin master
			-> merges the data from the local 'origin/master' Git folder to the 'master' local folder (merging might bring discrepancies - i.e. a line modified on Github & locally, they must be resolved before being able to end the merge command)
		git pull origin maser
			-> pull command = fetch & merge
