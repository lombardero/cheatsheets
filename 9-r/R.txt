Probabilistic functions
	Binomial distr
	 - rbinom(m, n, p): Creates vector of m cols with number of True statements of n 
			    binomial experiences following probability p of True
	 - dbinom(k, n, p): (density) probability of obtaining k Trues in n binomial
			    experiences with a probability of success p
	 - pinom(k, n, p):  probability of obtaining at least k Trues of n binomial
			     experiences with a probability of success p

Functions
	  - mean(): calculates the mean values of a row vector (treats booleans as 1s and
		     0s).
	  - var(): calculates the variance of a set of data in a vector
