# Flutter widgets

// https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter Apps. Anything that can be seen in an App
is a Widget (even what holds all widgets together). Some can define large scale parts
of the application such as Bars, Images, Lists, or Buttons, and some other can define
very simple elements such as text. The app is built by interconnecting and adding
widgets onto each other to for the widget tree, which adds the complexity.

> Note: widgets are classes in Dart, they need to be defined

> Note 2: it is considered good practice to puy one widget per file. (helps
> performance and readability).

>  Reminder:
> - ress `Ctlr + Space` in VS code to see the arguments
> - use `Alt + Shift + F` to auto-format the code
> - use `^ Shift R` to make Refactor suggestions
> - use `Cmd + D` (while selecting something) to select more
> of that instance on the same file

# 1 - Output & Input widgets

The widgets in this category are 'Visible', and show something on the UI that either
shows something (such as text), or/and await for a user input (such as buttons) These
widges are normally the 'leaves' of the UI tree.

These widges are Text fields, Titles, Buttons, etc.

## 1.1 Text widget

```dart
Text('text goes here', style: TextStyle(...), *args)
```
- defines a text entry (simple), expects the below arguments:
  - `style`: expects a [`TextStyle` object](#textstyle-object)
  - `textAlign`: a [`TextAlign` object](#textalign-object)

### `TextStyle` object

Text style object allows to change the appearance of text (such as font size):

```dart
TextStyle(fontSize: 28)
```
- defines the style of the text thanks to a `TextStlye` object, which takes in arguments
  such as `fontSize`

> Note: check the documentation [here](https:api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html).

### `TextAlign` object

The text alignment can be defined through a `TextAlign` object:

```dart
textAlign: TextAlign(...)
```

A special method allows us to define an alignment with specific properties, such an
alignment in the center:

```dart
textAlign: TextAlign.center
```
- the `center` method instantiates a `TextAlign` class with text alignment in the
  center, `TextAlign` supports other typical values such as `left`, `right` or `end`
  

## 1.2 Title widget

```dart
    Title('Text goes here')
        -> title is a different type of Widget than text
    AppBar(title: Text('title'),)
        -> defines an 'AppBar' (top bar of the app) widget, which
           expects many other widgets such as 'Title', and by
           default will be a blue bar.
        title: Text(...)
          -> expects a 'Text' widget, and will be placed in the
             center of the App Bar by default.
```

### 1.3 Button

```dart
    RaisedButton(child: Text(...), onPressed: null)
        -> is a widget to output a rectangular button (default)
        color: Color(hexcode)  or Color.blue
          -> will color the button with the indicated color, this
             argument expects a Color class.
             Colors.blue is a static property of the class (pre-
             defined value on the class) -> does not create an
             instance of the class, only an object (optimized)
        textColor: Color(hexcode)  or Color.white
          -> sets the color of the text, expects a 'Color' object
        child: Widget
          -> will allow to add anything to the button (text,
             color, whatever we want)
        onPressed: function
          -> defines the action to be taken if the button is
             pressed. It expects a void function, which can be
             defined right on the spot, or named and re-used in
             many buttons
            onPressed: () => print('Button pressed!')

            onPressed: function 
               onPressed expects a function (which needs to be
               the name itself without parenthesis, since otherwise
               Flutter will execute it when the Widget is built, and
               we only want to execute it once the button is pressed
               Note: 'function' should be defined inside of the class
               where it belongs to, usually before the '@override' of
               the 'build' function.
              void function() {
                 do something
                print('Button pressed!')
              }
                -> will create a function that prints 'Button pressed!'
                   on the logger of the terminal (do not see in the app)
            onPressed: () => print('Button pressed!')
              -> generates a nameless function directly for the button
                 (takes no arguments and prints something)
            onPressed: () {
              print('Button pressed!')
              }
              -> same as preceding line (different syntax)
            onPressed: null 
               will disable the button (will not do anything)

    Card()
```

# 2 - Layout widgets

Also called "Building block" widgets; they are usually not visible. These widgets are
a bit more complex than the basic ones, and allow us to assemble the basic UI
components. They are usually placed close to the 'root' of the UI tree, and expect
other widgets as arguments.

## 2.1 Material app

```DART
MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(...)
)
```
- `MaterialApp` is a building block widget in Flutter, it Usually sits at the root of
  the UI tree and expects many other widgets as arguments to build the App.

## 2.2 Scaffold

```dart
Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(...),
    body: Text('Default text'),
)
```
- One of Flutter's classic Widgets, it accepts many other widgets as arguments such
  as `appBar`, `body`, etc:
  - `appBar`: expects an `AppBar` widget, which by default is a blue top bar with some
    text on it.
  - body: is the remaining part of the display, by default, the background will be
    white and the written text will be dark grey.
> Note: 'body' only accepts one Widget as output, in case we wanted to input more
> Widgets, we need to use a layout widget

## 2.3 Container

```dart
    Container(
      width: double.infinity,
      child: Widget...,
    )
```
- Containers are 'Rectangles' that wrap another widget inside. The main content is the
  child Widget, which gets wrapped by a Padding around it until the container Border
  (which can also have width), and a Margin between the container and other Outside Widgets.
  Arguments:
  - `child: Widget`: defines the widget that will be wrapped inside of it, expects a
  `Widget` object.
  - `width: num`: defines the width of the container, it can be set to infinity
  `double.infinity` to make sure it takes as much space as it can
  - `margin: EdgeInsets`: margin defines the spacing between the container and any
  neighbouring Widgets, it can be set to some value using `EdgeInserts.all()` (all directions) or
  `EdgeInserts.only()` (one direction only). Example: `margin: EdgeInserts.all(10)`
      

## 2.4 Row widget

```dart
Row()
```

## 2.5 Column widget
```dart
Column(children: <Widget>[Widget1, Widget2, Widget3,...])
```
- allows to put widgets on top of each other by listing them. Arguments:
  - `children`: expects a list of Widgets, which will be placed on top of each other.

## 2.6 List view

```dart
    ListView()
```
