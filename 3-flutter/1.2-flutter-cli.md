# Flutter CLI

# 1 - Flutter commands

## Sanity check

Flutter comes in with a `doctor` command allowing to check if all parts are installed
properly:
```sh
$ flutter doctor
```
- checks that all parts are installed as they should. If they are not, follow
  [the instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Run the application

```sh
flutter run
```
- Will start the flutter application (will require a working mobile device to work)


# 2 - Other useful commands

## Open the Mac simulator

```sh
$ open -a Simulator
```
