# Flutter code organisation

# 1 - The `main` function

In Dart (as in many other programming languages), `main` is the application entrypoint,
it is the first function that will be called from which the remaining of the code will
be.

It looks like this: `void main()`

If we want to start an application, for example, we can define:

```dart
void main() {
    runApp(MyWidget());
}
```
- this runs an application using the `runApp()` function, which is a Flutter built-in
  function that basically generates the UI taking the whole Widget tree defined in
  `MyWidget()`.
