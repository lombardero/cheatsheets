# Object Oriented programming in Dart

As an Object-Oriented programming language, all variables in `Dart` are classes. This document explains how new classes can be defined and used.

## 1 - Basics
### 1.1 Creating a class instance (without constructor)
Classes allow us to group data and functions together, let's start with the basics. 

#### Defining a class
```dart
class Person {
    String name = 'Default';
    var age = 28;
}
```
- the code above defines a class `Person` with two predefined attributes; this attributes will be available to query using `<instanceName>.<variableName>`.

#### Defining an instance
```dart
var person1 = Person();
```
- defines `person1`, which is an instance of the class `Person`. Since no data was instroduced, the data stored in `person1` is the default oe.

#### Accessing the data of the instance
```dart
person1.age
```
- will return the `age` property of the instance `person1`, in this case, `28`.

```dart
person1.name = 'Manu'
```
- allows us to update the `name` property to `person1`.

### 1.2 Using the Constructor
The constructor is a function ran automatically every time a class is instantiated. It is called a 'constructor' since it conglomerates all the computations required for the class to exist (mandatory inputs, initial variables, etc.).

Important note: in `Dart`, the constructor of the class is a special function inside of the class that takes the same name of the class itself (that is the way that `Dart` will identify the constructor). The arguments we add in the constructor will be required for the class to initialize (`Dart` will throw an error otherwise).

#### 'Long' and explicit definition
Following our previous example, the class `Person` will require a `Person()` constructor. 

```dart
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String inputName, int age) {
        name = inputName;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```
- the code above defines an empty class requiring two inputs to initialize.

Note: before using any variable in the contrustor, we need to initialize it first within the class (as we do above with `String name;` and `int age`).

Note 2: we use the keyword `this` to refer to the argument '`age`' of the class `Person()`, which is set equal to the second argument of the constructor also called '`age`'. (This is avoidable using another name for the argument of the constructor, as we do with `name`).

#### 'Short' syntax
The same functionality we wrote above can be written using the following code:
```dart
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
    
    Person(this.name, this.age);
}
```
- this code defines an empty class requiring two arguments to initialize. This syntax is an in-built shortcut to build the class easily (the constructor understands that `this.name` and `this.age` are instantiated in the constructor).

Now that we have created a class, we can define an instance as follows:

```dart
person1 = Person('Manu', 28);
```
- creates an instance of the `Person` class.

### 1.3 Explaining the `this` statement
The `this` statement is a borrowed idea from Javascript. `this` stands for 'whatever is responsible from calling the code'. In the above example, since the `Person` class instance is responsible of calling the `Person()` constructor, `this` will pointed to the `Person` class instance (therefore, calling `this.name` will be the same as calling `person1.name`).

More on JavaScript's `this` statement on [this other post I made](https://github.com/lombardero/cheatsheets/blob/master/4-javascript/2-objects-js.md#23-the-this-statement).
