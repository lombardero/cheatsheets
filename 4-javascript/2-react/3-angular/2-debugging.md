# Debugging


Clicking the "Inspect" tab in Google chrome opens the debug console.
- The `Network` tab shows us the HTTP calls made by the fronted, and all files loaded
  - We can also set the internet speed slower (to debug timing issues)
- Common JS error message: "Cannot read property x of undefiled" > This is a null pointer exception!

- Use StackBlitz to recreate a smaller version of the issue (mini version of your code that runs dynamically)
