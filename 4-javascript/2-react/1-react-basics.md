# React basics

React is a JavaScript library that makes user interfaces feel "reactive". In
web browsers, loading the whole HTML -if it is big- might hinder performance
of the page. That is where JavaScript and React come into the rescue.

As it runs in the browser, it is considered a "client"-side library. 

It splits the logic of building a UI into smaller components, making the code
more readable and maintainable.

## Single-page applications

Single-page Applications (SPAs) are applications (such as the Netflix page)
which renders an entire HTML page which is fully controlled dynamically by
JavaScript (React). It loads everything and displays what the user needs
dynamically.

This is different from the widget approach, in which different
parts of the pages are rendered and served by a backend.
